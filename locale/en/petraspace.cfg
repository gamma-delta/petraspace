[technology-description]
data-cards=Data cards store scientific research data. They can usually be re-used after the data is used to make science packs. Data does not stay good for very long; [item=expired-data-card]s must be formatted before reuse.

bauxite-hint=Bauxite is an ore of aluminum, a metal crucial for spaceflight. It is impossible to process bauxite except by chemical means.
simple-bauxite-extraction=Laboriously extract [item=aluminum-nugget] by washing bauxite with high-pressure steam and sulfuric acid.
# there seems to be no consistency in vanilla about when and where to put item tags
advanced-bauxite-extraction=Bauxite can be melted into [fluid=bauxite-liquor], then electrolyzed using [item=carbon-fiber] as an electrode to separate [fluid=molten-aluminum].
