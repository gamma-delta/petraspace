spoiling-data-cards=Data cards spoil

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
spoiling-data-cards=[item=blank-data-card] can be programmed with scientific research data to be used in the production of science.\nThe data on them does not stay good for forever; programmed cards spoil into [item=expired-data-card], which you then have to format for a chance to get the card back. Using a programmed card for research has a much higher chance to get the blank card back intact.\nShown above is [item=orbital-data-card] used in [item=orbital-science-pack].
