[technology-description]
data-cards=Data cards store scientific research data. They can usually be re-used after the data is used to make science packs. Programmed data cards spoil into [item=expired-data-card], which must be formatted before reuse.

bauxite-hint=Bauxite is an ore of aluminum, a metal crucial for spaceflight. It is impossible to process bauxite except by chemical means.
simple-bauxite-extraction=Laboriously extract [item=aluminum-nugget] by washing bauxite with high-pressure steam and sulfuric acid.
# there seems to be no consistency in vanilla about when and where to put item tags
advanced-bauxite-extraction=Reduce bauxite into [fluid=bauxite-liquor], then electrolyze it using [item=carbon-fiber] as an electrode to separate [fluid=molten-aluminum].

[factoriopedia-description]
bauxite-ore=On Nauvis, only spawns as inclusions within stone ore.

spoiling-data-cards=Data cards spoil

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
spoiling-data-cards=[item=blank-data-card] can be programmed with scientific research data to be used in the production of science.\nThe data on them does not stay good for forever; programmed cards spoil into [item=expired-data-card], which you then have to format for a chance to get the card back. Using a programmed card for research has a much higher chance to get the blank card back intact.\nShown above is [item=orbital-data-card] used in [item=orbital-science-pack].
