viate-welcome=Viate briefing
viate-dust=Dust

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
viate-welcome=[planet=viate] is the only moon of [planet=nauvis]. It has no atmosphere, but its regolith is rich in [item=iron-ore], [item=bauxite-ore], and [item=stone] where it's been kicked up by meteors. It also contains deposits of [item=ice] in the shadows of its maria. It should be a good place to research and gather the materials required to make your first space platform.
viate-dust=On some bodies with a low atmosphere or high electrostatic charge, mechanical activity will kick up abrasive dust from the surface into a pollutant. It appears light blue on the map. Dust does not attract enemies in any way; instead, it slows down the activity of complex machines (mostly, those with module slots).\nPaving the ground helps reduce the amount of dust produced -- fortunately it is easy to produce [recipe=stone-bricks-from-regolith] on [planet=viate]. More advanced pavement tamps down the dust more. Later you will discover more active ways to remove dust from the air.\nThe simulation above takes place on a surface with dust. For demonstration purposes, the [entity=big-mining-drill] generate more dust than they would normally. The lamps show the throughput of the belt from 1-8; note how the amount of [item=ice] on the belt slowly goes down over time as the [entity=big-mining-drill] gets jammed by the dust.
