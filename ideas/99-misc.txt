=== Environmental Station ===
(If I go thru with planet Chronos, this will be the Chronos/Gleba/Vulcanus
research.)
Acts as a bigger radar.
Can read basically any information I can think it ought to:
- Pollution levels
- Evolution level
- Time of day
- Wind X/Y
- Planet gravity?
- Nastiest enemy in range?
I want to feel like this is a pretty epic upgrade...
but I'm ok with it being the worst of them.
(For example, use this to turn on electrostatic funnelers only at night!)

Would be funny to have a radioactive item that decays in several years.
