=== Environmental Station ===
(If I go thru with planet Chronos, this will be the Chronos/Gleba/Vulcanus
research.)
Acts as a bigger radar.
Can read basically any information I can think it ought to:
- Pollution levels
- Evolution level
- Time of day
- Wind X/Y
- Planet gravity?
- Nastiest enemy in range?
I want to feel like this is a pretty epic upgrade...
but I'm ok with it being the worst of them.
(For example, use this to turn on electrostatic funnelers only at night!)

Would be funny to have a radioactive item that decays in several years.

=== Gravitational Anomalies ===
The way you discover the Shattered Planet.
Somewhat of a new game plus? It's impractically expensive to make
the superluminal jump over there again.
Or perhaps there is a gravity well making it impossible to
go there again.

Discover gravitational anomaly data first off the (little tiny)
surface of the moon of Vulcanus.
(see: relativity & Mercury orbit)

=== Advanced Chemistry ===

Take a note out of Nullius' book: plastic!
Everybody needs plastic!
Perhaps make it out of wood in some way, so you actually have reason to create
wood farms on Nauvis.

=== Space Elevator ===

What if it was just a bidirectional underground belt?
Or secretly a train?
(In fact, SE just has the space elevator be a train teleporter, somehow)
A single train car would be a lot more interesting than a bidi belt.

It would need a "behind-the-scenes" area to hide the trains and stuff.
However if I learned anything from FF's impl, that's going to be a pain.
