Viat√©: the moon of Nauvis

Natural resources:
- Regolith, processable into silicon, iron, and stone, and small amounts of aluminum
- Ice, in small formations near cliffs
Extremely high solar power production, but slow day-cycle, requiring prodigious numbers of accumulators or storing tons of heat in water.
- Research thermal solar panels

Pollution: dust!
- Mechanical activity produces airborne dust, which slows down machines.
  (implement as a beacon sitting on any entity you place?)
- Robots hate them!
- You can spray it down with water, or just big-dick it with moar speed
- Stone bricks, concrete, and refined concrete help damp it down
- On Fulgora, you get electrostatic funnelers, which are even better at removing it

Regolith has many ways to process it.
- Smelt into stone bricks.
- Wash with water into a little bit of silicon, stone, and iron ore.
- Wash with sulfuric acid into a lot of silicon, a little bit of stone, and a chance of aluminum nuggets.
  Aluminum lets you make more LDS!
  (I've fiddled with these recipes since)

The landmark research here is the Logistic Railgun, which you can only build on
surfaces with low gravity (like Viate!), but is much cheaper to send up items.
Notably, the capsules do not require LDS.
Perhaps the more segments of railgun you stick end-to-end, the more weight it can carry in one capsule,
but the more power-hungry it gets. <-- bikeshedding

Unclear if I can ship things directly from Viate to Nauvis w/o using a space
platform intermediary.
FFF 437 suggests the engine supports it but perhaps not the modding API?
In any case I can just shoot the pod out of the railgun to the platform,
although I may need some conceit as to how the pod goes up at the end.
Frosted glass or tubes or something can probably do a lot of the heavy
lifting here: stuff goes into a cylinder, there's a THWNK, and the pod
is accellerated to the side and up.
FRUSTRATINGLY, each rocket can only have the same max weight.
(But can multiply rocket cost by the reciprocal)
