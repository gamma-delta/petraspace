The second trip to Fulgora has you making the Subatomic Science Pack.
(oooh I wonder what happened to the Fulgorans? why can you extract
plutonium from scrap? ooooh)

Particle Accelerators.
Because I think factorio should have a horrid fiddly multiblock.
- Make "particle stream" or whatever a fluid. Its energy is represented
  as its heat (it's all joules in the backend!)
- The accelerator is made out of many stretches of fluidboxes.
- Source component takes raw atomic mix and turns it into particle stream.
- Normal "pipes" cool down the particle stream, especially turns.
  = Can impl these as FluidEnergySources, although I need somewhere to
    void the energy to...
- Accelerator components heat up the particle stream.
- The center accelerator component has a FluidEnergySource that consumes
  particle stream and outputs power based on its heat.
  Has some very high passive power drain but cheap to run recipes,
  so you "power" it with high-energy particles and the more energy you give it,
  the quicker goes the irradiation.

Two possible design ideas:
- Stream mode.
  Make the heat penalties for sitting in connectors very high, and make
  accelerators shut down (or explode?!) if there's too much fluid in them.
  This way you have to produce streams of particles and can't let them buffer.
  (Any amount of fluid sitting in a boiler can eventually reach infinity degrees,
  because the input and output pipes are both the same fluidbox.)
- Storage mode.
  Have particle storage be an explicit part of the design.
  Heat particles higher and higher overnight, then dump their energy during the
  day.
  The "storage tanks" are secretly FluidEnergySources that cool down the fluid.
  Can probably do this by having the irradiator take a small amount of energy
  to remain running and a huge amount to do the craft; this way you're encouraged
  to get the fluid as hot as possible to make the crafts go faster.
