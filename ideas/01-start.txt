Decided to split this into multiple files for ease of use.

Stage 1: Nauvis.

Red, Green, and Blue Science.
MO here is making the early game more interesting
(is change for the sake of change worth it?)
- Make steel require coal or carbon, so you can't make it without carbon.
  Perhaps make foundry recipe require CO2?
- Blurcuits require silicon, which is laboriously extracted from stone & sulfuric acid
- Precision optical components, for lasers.
  Difficult to craft on Nauvis due to high pressure (?)

Circuits. I like Gregtech's implementation of circuits, how they get more complicated
but cheaper overall.
However this conflicts with recyclers... unless!
- Make circuits out of tiers of substrate, wire, semiconductors, components

Q 2   2   2   2
or something

LDS requires aluminum. How do I make it prohibitively expensive but still possible on Nauvis?
Drop from your crashed spaceship?
(have since implemented this as bauxite inclusions)
Flying robot frames also probably require LDS?

Orbital data. Craft telescopes that you must supply with power and data cards.
- Programmed data cards spoil into blank cards again
- Nauvis does not produce very good orbital data due to high pressure
- But Viate does! Hold your horses
Astrodynamic science pack:
- Orbital data card(s)
- Space platform (now feat. LDS?)
- Electric motor
Consume some small number of these to discover Viate.
(the engineer is incapable of looking up)
The distance between Nauvis and Viate's orbits should be quite small.

Do I want to make data cards really cheap and reusable?
Or each one an investment?
I like the second -- better reuse them because otherwise you're throwing away
nice data cards.
