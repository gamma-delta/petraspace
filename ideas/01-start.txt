Decided to split this into multiple files for ease of use.

Stage 1: Nauvis.

I want the early game to be different, but I don't want it to be making up mechanics
to get mad at.
Ugh I really don't want to add sand and silicon. Everyone adds sand and silicon.
It is a good "cheat" for making the early game more interesting, though.

I could make a lot of "mall ingredients" require steel, like fast belts...

Circuits. Everyone always needs more circuits. The early-game intermediates are
- Circuits
- Gears
- Steel
One idea is to have a "simple" and "advanced" way to make early-game intermediates.
Simple way is really slow, complex way has way more throughput.
Planet's machines require the complex way.

How do other overhauls change the early game?
- SE:
  = Burner age, which can die in a fire
  = Meteorites and CMEs
  = Many intermediates: small engines, motors, engines, sand&glass (augh), heat shields,
  = Buildings require stone bricks and conc reat (BEPs require concrete! i knew i wasn't imagining that)
  = Circuits require stone or wood (recycler breaks this w/o a "substrate" intermediate)
- Krastorio
  = Bootstrap with crashed ship machinery.
    This might be a good way to pre-introduce advanced recipes!
  = Worse ore ratios
  = Burner furnaces suck
  = Intermediates: Automation cores, inserter parts, electric components
  = Cool new guns
  = tEcH cArDs
  = Offshore pumps require electricity, ofc, lmao
- Factorio+
  = New early-game miners: pick your poisons.

Early-game intermediates ideas?
- Engines: Vulc
- Motors: Fulg
- Precision movement: Gleba
- Heat shielding / reinforced plating: Vulc
- Circuits but worse: Fulgora
- Cabling: Fulgora
- Plastic: Glorbo
- Basically anything oil: Glardo
- (Interesting idea: Gleckler oil tech *starts* with gas and you thicken it twice)
- Food?????

SA's infinite prod researches indicate that each rocket part has an ingredient associated w/ each planet
- LDS for Vulcanus
- Blurcuits for Fulgora
- Rocket fuel for Gleba
Ofc I've changed it to be LDS, blurcuits, and POCs. But that ordering still seems to work.
(NB I can re-add rocket control units and require whatever I want in addition to blurcuits
in order to balance ... what if I required orbital data cards??)

Circuits. Always back to circuits.
The problem here is that adding better and better "electronic components" recipes
reduces Fulgora's ability to crunch up circits into rudiments.
(Again unless I make the better recipes be fluids or "trace amounts")
I could use my tiered circuits idea ("my").
The ingredients that are *mandatory* for red circuits can *boost*
green circuits. And so on.
- Copper wire
- Substrate
- Plastic
- Sulfuric acid
- Holmium soln (superconductors are "circuits" IG)
- Whatever

Do I go back to data cards?
The problem is quality.
But, if I do my ideas about changing/removing quality ...

How do infinite productivity loops work anyways?
In vanilla you can only do this with infinite productivity research.
- +50% from planetary building inherently
- +125% from up to 5 legendary prod 3s
- = 175%
- This leaves 125% to play with
- So, I can add recipes that yield up to a little over 2x
  efficiency?
- Problem being that you can prod *those* recipes.

Base: 1 -> 1
Prod: 1 -> 2.75
Plus: 1 -> 2
PrPl: 1 -> 5.50 !!
Probably many ways to fix this.
