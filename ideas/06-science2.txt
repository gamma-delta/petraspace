Each t2 science should use other planets' ingredients in *non-trivial* quantities.
Well maybe it can use a little bit in trivial quantities but scale is interesting.

Also on each t1 I've seeded a surprise tool that will help us later.
(STTWHUL)

== Vulcanus: Materials Science Pack ==
(Is there a better name for this? Material science science pack. Material science science science science science science)

STTWHUL: Mag slag from quickening and some other slag from geo heat exchangers.
TODO: make GHX "burn" exchanger components that you eventually harvest the
slag off of.
IRL lava really has very little metal in it so I can invent whatever I want here.

Make two alloys here: Pridwensteel and Magpie Alloy.
Pridwensteel is preturnaturally tough, Magpie alloy is preturnaturally light
and conductive.
- Pridwensteel: W, DU, Steel, 
- Magpie alloy: Al, Cu, Ho, Mg, Li

How do I make gleba useful in any way? Yumako mash into intumescent barrier.

== Fulgora: Subatomic Science Pack ==

STTWHUL: Archaeological scrap. Analyze it with spectroscopy or grind it up
for random bullshit.

Something with jelly here? Laser calibration? Only good source of some resource?
Organolanthanithenides?

I might bump superconductors back to t2. Perhaps you can get it out of archa
scrap?
Holmium isn't actually used for that much, funnily enough. Perhaps you make it
into electromagnets?
Electromagnets recycle into unmagnetic iron?
Superconductors are really fantastic technology IRL and I feel they should be
pushed back.

Idea: Electroplants require superconductors, which you can *only* get from
archaeological scrap (and ruins?) at first.
