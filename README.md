## Credits and Attributions

This mod stands on the shoulders of giants.

### Asset Attribution

Assets responsibly sourced from the following locations:

[**Hurricane's Renders**](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Hurricane046): Graphics for the Geothermal Heat Exchanger.

[**Malcolm Riley's Unused Renders**](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-renders/tree/main): Graphics for
- Aluminum plates
- Native aluminum
- Precision optical components
- Regolith (item and tech icon)
- Fertilizer
- Hydrogen, oxygen, nitric acid
- Molten aluminum
- Bauxite liquour
- Electrolysis technology

I'd also like to give Malcolm Riley a special shout-out for publishing tutorials on how to make Factorio-like assets, and for being really kind when I reached out to him. I would not have made any Blender assets if not for them.

The rest of them I made myself.
I used Blender and GIMP for the sprites.
I kitbashed a lot of the graphics together out of other sprites:
- Lunar rocket silos
- Boompuff propagules
- Science packs
- All the tiles
- Archaeological scrap

Pro tip: use GIMP's Rotate Color to recolor Factorio assets. Or, select by color with feathering, cut it, and paste it in a new layer with the blend mode set to "mix". Both look much better than plain tints.

### Code Attribution
